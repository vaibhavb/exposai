# Guns, Goons and Votes: The Culture of Violence in Indian Politics

Indian politics has long been plagued by the phenomenon of criminals entering electoral fray. The trend has only intensified over the years, with many candidates having criminal cases against them. This culture of violence in Indian politics is a significant concern as it undermines the very fabric of democracy.

## The Problem

Our dataset consists of information on candidates who contested various state and national elections in India, including details on their party affiliation, number of criminal cases, state, election year, and specific charges.

**1. Count of Criminals by Party Affiliation**
```js
const p = db.sql`
                SELECT 
                    Party, 
                    COUNT(*) AS num_criminals
                FROM 
                    candidates
                WHERE 
                    "Criminal Cases"  > 0
                GROUP BY 
                    party
                ORDER BY 
                    num_criminals DESC
                LIMIT 10;
                `
Inputs.table(p);
```
```js
Plot.plot({
  marks: [
    Plot.barY(p, {x: "Party", y: "num_criminals"})
  ]
})
```

The data reveals that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has the highest number of criminal cases, followed closely by the Indian National Congress (INC).

**2. List of Criminals with Most Number of Cases**
```js
const c = db.sql`
                SELECT 
                    Candidate, 
                    COUNT(*) AS total_cases
                FROM 
                    candidates
                WHERE 
                    "Criminal Cases"  > 0
                GROUP BY 
                    Candidate
                ORDER BY 
                    total_cases DESC
                LIMIT 10;`
view(Inputs.table(await c));
```

The top 10 most criminal candidates in Indian elections are dominated by politicians from the BJP and INC.

**3. Criminals by Constituency**

```js
const t = db.sql`
            SELECT 
                Constituency, 
                COUNT(*) AS num_criminals
            FROM 
                candidates
            WHERE 
                "Criminal Cases"  > 0
            GROUP BY 
                Constituency
            ORDER BY 
                num_criminals DESC
            LIMIT 10;`
view(Inputs.table(await t));
```

## The Impact

The culture of violence in Indian politics has serious implications for democracy and governance. It creates an environment where criminals can use their wealth and influence to buy their way into power, rather than being accountable to the people. This undermines the very principles of democratic representation and accountability.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the phenomenon of criminals entering electoral fray is a significant concern in Indian politics. The data suggests that this trend is widespread and affects all major political parties. It is essential for policymakers and civil society to work together to address this issue and ensure that elections are free from violence and intimidation.
